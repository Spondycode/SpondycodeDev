            <p class="py-6">
              It's easy to add the data to the app. Pick a date, Add details like the Odometer reading. Optional to add a What3Words address to help you find the location for the next time. Your charging networks are in a drop down menu. Select the one you want to use and add the details of the charging session. 
            </p>
            <p>Keep track of the percentage of charge at the start and the percentage of charge at the end. Add the cost of the charging session. Add any notes you want to add. There is a button to give you the approximate kWhs added based on the percentage of charge at the start and the percentage of charge at the end. Just for when the app or the charging point doesn't give you the kWhs added. I need that feature when charging at home. Add the cost per kWh and there's another button to calculate the cost of the charging session based on the kWhs added and the cost per kWh.</p>
            <p>In my BYD Dolphin it gives me a number which tells me the kWhs used per 100 kms. So there is a field for that. You may like to see the metric in the form of kms per kWh, have a look at the page in the app which will calculate that for you. It will also convert that number into miles per kWh. </p>
